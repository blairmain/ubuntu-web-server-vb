# ubuntu-web-server-vb

Working with a ubuntu server 14.04 LTS.

Creating a template server to function as a base for deploying web server solutions quickly.

Ubuntu Web Server will include:

-OpenSSH server/client
-DNS server
-LAMP Server (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
-GIT
-RVM
-NodeJS

I intend on writing start-up bash scripts to simplify the process of creating a unique system, after the initial spec.

The ultimate goal is to create an easy to deploy solution, that may be accessible from the cloud, or a MAAS server.
